# Renewable energy sources in different countries


## Introduction
In this project I explore what is the contribution of the renewable energy sources for electricity production in different counties and regions. Among the renewable energy sources are: solar, wind, hydroelectricity, tide and wave, geothermal. The goal is to find out what this percentange of renewable energy sources may depend on.

In this project I use web scrapping tool - BeautifulSoup - for collecting the data, pandas for creating the dataset, matplotlib for figures, plotly for creating a simple dashboard.
